        <h2>My Fantasy World</h2>
        <p>In my imagination, I see a great big forest, with very large trees, standing close to each other. Sunlight is streaming through the leaves, covering the forest with green light. There are silver and golden flowers on the ground, growing on big bushes. There are huge rainbow-coloured butterflies flying around the flowers, drinking their honey. There is a beautiful stream flowing through the forest. The sound of the water is very soothing, like music.</p>

        <p>I imagine there will be fairies in this forest. There are both wood fairies and water fairies. Wood fairies wear sparkling green clothes. They hide among the leaves and the branches of the trees. Their music is very beautiful. They use the wood from the trees to make their instruments, but these aren't familiar to us humans. Water fairies mostly swim under water or hide behind waterfalls. They wear sparkling blue clothes. Their dance is very graceful. They usually dance to the rhythm of the water. I have a lot of fun playing with the fairies..</p>

        <p>Sometimes, if you are very lucky, you can catch a glimpse of the magical unicorn. They are snow white in colour, with a rainbow coloured mane and a golden horn right in the middle of its forehead. Unicorns are the most beautiful creatures one can ever hope to see. They are very shy, so a human will rarely get to meet them. Since this is my fantasy world, I imagine that I am great friends with them.

            My fantasy world is very peaceful and quiet. It is full of love and compassion. It is a place where everyone is very happy and great friends with each other. I guess it is the opposite of the real world I am in.</p>
